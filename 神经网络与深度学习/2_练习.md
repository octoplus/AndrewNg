**What to remember from this assignment:**

- Preprocessing the dataset is important.
- You implemented each function separately: initialize(), propagate(), optimize(). Then you built a model().
- Tuning the learning rate (which is an example of a "hyperparameter") can make a big difference to the algorithm. You will see more examples of this later in this course!-
